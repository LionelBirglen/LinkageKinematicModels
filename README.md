# Common Linkages' Kinematic Models / MEC6319 Course
Support files for the kinematic analysis of a few sample linkages studied during the MEC6319 course at Polytechnique Montreal:
- the planar RRR serial chain
- the planar fourbar linkage 
- the slider-crank linkage

Run xxx_gui.m from Matlab to open a graphical user interface through which you can move and animate the linkage. Direct and inverse kinematics functions can also be used standalone. See each functions for how to use and syntax.
